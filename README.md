# Question No. 01: Calculate the sum, difference, product, and average of three numbers

# Function to perform calculations
def calculate_numbers(num1, num2, num3):
    total_sum = num1 + num2 + num3       # Sum of the numbers
    difference = num1 - num2 - num3      # Difference of the numbers
    product = num1 * num2 * num3         # Product of the numbers
    average = total_sum / 3               # Average of the numbers
    
    return total_sum, difference, product, average

# Example input
num1 = 5
num2 = 10
num3 = 15

# Get results
results = calculate_numbers(num1, num2, num3)

# Print results

# Question No. 02: Calculate the area of various shapes

# Function to calculate area of different shapes

# Example input for shapes

radius = 2

# Get area results
